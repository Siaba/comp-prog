The Fibonacci numbers are the numbers in the following integer sequence.<br>

0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89, 144, ……..<br>

In mathematical terms, the sequence Fn of Fibonacci numbers is defined by the recurrence relation:<br>

Fn = Fn-1 + Fn-2
where F0 = 0 , and F1 = 1.

Write a program that prints the Fibonacci Value of 20, or F19.
You have the choice for a recursive or iterative implementation.<br>

Expected Output:
4181
